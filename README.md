# CloudFlare-Dynamic-DNS-Updater
Dynamically update your DNS record with CloudFlare. Updated for Cloudflare API v4. Simple usage with Raspberry Pi.


## IMPORTANT
The original script is NOT mine. I was unable to find the original author on Github. I got a forked version from the user MyLesGray from his website https://blah.cloud/networks/raspberry-pi-dynamic-dns-using-cloudflare/ but it was written using CloudFlare's v1 API which will be retired on June 4th 2018. Without prior knowledge of bash scripts I decided to study the CloudFlare v4 API and update the script accordingly by myself. This is the end result, which is working fine for me, but I haven't tested it in every possible scenario. YMMV.
